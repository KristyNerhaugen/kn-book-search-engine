# Challenge Twenty One: KN Book Search Engine ![MIT badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

### For this challenge, I refactored starter code to turn a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This application can be used to search for books and to create an account to save book searches.

## Credits

### Starter code to refactor was provided for this application. Starter code can be found here: [Starter Code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli). I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to refactor this application. I especially used what I learned in Module 21 and the code that was given through Module 21 as a guide for this challenge. I referred to the React docs throughout: [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). I specifically relied on the documentation about the useEffect hook and fetching, which can be found here: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html. I also used the [Apollo Graph QL docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#input-types) to better understand Graph QL schema and input types.
